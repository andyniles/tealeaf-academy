Lesson 1: Variable scope

Play around with variable scope and test out different scenarios.

1 Create a local variable and modify it at an inner scope (in between a do/end block). 
You can try

    a) re-assigning the variable to something else
    b) call a method that doesnâ€™t mutate the caller
    c) call a method that mutates the caller.

2 Create a local variable at an inner scope (within a do/end block) and try to 
reference it in the outer scope. What happens when you have nested do/end blocks?

    e = "this is e"
    puts e
    puts d
  end
  # next line will cause an error because we are now out of scope of e
  #puts e
end
# the next two lines will cause an error because both d and e are now out of scope
#puts d
#puts e
